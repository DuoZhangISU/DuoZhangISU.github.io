Hi! I'm Duo Zhang, a Ph.D. student in [DSL](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~mai/lab/dsl.html) at Iowa State University. I'm interested in all things involving storage system. 

My work and research
======
My current research focuses on storage system failures diagnosis and bug detection in persistent memory based system. My project involves virtual machines and staic analysis (LLVM).
