Hi! I'm Duo Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate in [Data Storage Lab](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~mai/lab/dsl.html) at Iowa State University. I'm interested in all things involving the storage system. 

For more information, please click here for the [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/celestial-d/celestial-d.github.io/blob/master/files/CV.pdf)

My research interests focus on exploration of bug reproducibility and the reliability issues of the storage system with emerging storage technologies (e.g., persistent memory). Specifically, I am interested in developing noval system testing frameworks through state-art-of-tools (i.e., virtual machines (QEMU), tracers(e.g., kprobe) and static analysis (LLVM)).
